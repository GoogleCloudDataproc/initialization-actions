# This script installs the Stackdriver agent on your Cloud Dataproc
# cluster so you can monitor your cluster with Stackdriver.
#
# Once you create a cluster with this initialization action, you will
# need to perform some configuration in Stackdriver. Specifically, you must
# create a group based on the cluster name prefix. This will detect any new
# instances created with that prefix and use this group as the basis for
# your alerting policies and dashboards

# Download and run the Stackdriver installation script
