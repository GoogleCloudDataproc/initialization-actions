# Customize environment

This initialization action customizes the environment of all current and future
non-system users on the VM. If you wish to ssh into your cluster a lot and
prefer to customize the user environment, this script provides a starting point
reference.


By default it only enables the options already present in the .bashrc that
Debian provides, but it documents where further changes can be made and gives
some commented out examples.
