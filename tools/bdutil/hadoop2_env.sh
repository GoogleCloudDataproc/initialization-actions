# Decimal number controlling the size of map containers in memory and virtual

# allocation, each map task will be given a container with roughly
# (CORES_PER_MAP_TASK / <total-cores-on-node>) share of the memory available to
# the NodeManager for containers. Thus an n1-standard-4 with CORES_PER_MAP_TASK
# set to 2 would be able to host 4 / 2 = 2 map containers (and no other
# containers). For more details see the script 'libexec/configure-mrv2-mem.py'.
